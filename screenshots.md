# Organize Downloads in Feeds

<img class="screenshot" src="/assets/images/screenshots/feeds.png" />

Subscribe to each feed separately, or to all your downloads via "All Downloads":
<img class="screenshot" src="/assets/images/screenshots/subscribe.png" />

<img class="screenshot mobile" src="/assets/images/screenshots/pa-subscribe.jpg" />
<img class="screenshot mobile" src="/assets/images/screenshots/pa-play.jpg" />

# Fully Responsive

The site works well on all devices:<br />
<img class="screenshot mobile" src="/assets/images/screenshots/mobile.png" />
<img class="screenshot mobile" src="/assets/images/screenshots/mobile-sidebar.png" />

# On-Site Player

Play the downloaded media directly on the site:
<img class="screenshot" src="/assets/images/screenshots/player.png" />

You can use the site while the player keeps playing in the corner:
<img class="screenshot" src="/assets/images/screenshots/player-small.png" />

# Authentication
